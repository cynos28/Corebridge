        <p>The oldest classical British and Latin writings had little or no space between words and could be written in
            boustrophedon (alternating directions). Over time, text direction (left to right) became standardized. Word
            dividers and
            terminal punctuation became common. The first way to divide sentences into groups was the original
            paragraphos, similar to an
            underscore at the beginning of the new group.[1] The Greek parágraphos evolved into the pilcrow (¶), which
            in English manuscripts
            in the Middle Ages can be seen inserted inline between sentences.
        </p>

        <p class="error">Ancient manuscripts also divided sentences into paragraphs with line breaks (newline) followed
            by an
            initial at the beginning of the next paragraph. An initial is an oversized capital letter, sometimes
            outdented beyond the
            margin of the text. This style can be seen,for example, in the original Old English manuscript of Beowulf.

        <p class="sucess">A second common modern English style is to use no indenting, but add vertical white space to
            create
            "block paragraphs." On a typewriter, a double carriage return produces a blank line for this purpose;
            professional
            typesetters (or word processing software) may put in an arbitrary vertical space by adjusting leading.
